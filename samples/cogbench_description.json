    "Description": [
      "The scene is in the kitchen, where three people are present: a boy, a girl, and a woman. The woman is likely the mother. The boy is standing on a stool to reach for cookies in the cookie jar high up in the cabinet. The girl is standing on the ground next to the boy, reaching out to take the cookie he is handing her. The stool the boy is standing on is slightly tilted, and the boy is about to fall. The girl is shushing him and smiling. They are standing behind the mother and stealing cookies. They are happy and cautious. The mother, wearing an apron, is standing sideways in front of the sink. She is washing dishes using a piece of cloth. The faucet is left running, causing water to overflow onto the floor. However, the mother seems somewhat absent-minded, possibly lost in thought, and hasn't noticed the running faucet or the water on the floor. There are also two cups and a plate on the table. There are curtains hanging above the window. Looking through the window, we can see another house, as well as a tree and some bushes in the distance."

The boy took off his dirty clothes and shoes, and went to take a shower. The mother wearing an apron is putting a piece of clothing into the washing machine. She is probably washing the dirty clothes that the boy took off. The boy has finished taking a bath and is asking his mother for clothes. A girl, perhaps the sister of the boy, is wiping the floor with a rag. There is a bucket of water and a sponge near the girl. She is wiping the floor that the boy dirtied. Because the boy stretched his foot out of the bath after washing, and dirtied the floor again, the girl is angrily staring at the boy."
